# nosql_challenge
Module 12 graded assignment

The goal of this assignment was to use NoSQL to evaluate restaurant ratings data for a given stakeholder. 

* Data (in json format) was imported and a name was given to the database and the collection.
* PyMongo and Pretty Print libraries were imported.
* Mongo Client was started and the creation of the database and collection was verified.
* Code was then written to answer queries and to update the database.

No resources outside of class materials were used for this challenge, with the exception of a discussion
regarding question #3 (locations within a certain distance of Penang Flavours). Ideas were shared between
myself and Kenny Ross, and also between myself and Cassidy Simmons.
